##-- options section
; If auto_file_creation=Yes, then the users can create data files. It IS
;  dangerous to set this option to Yes.
#
; strict_mode=Yes or No. Run the program in strict mode or not. It's a good
;  idea to set this option to Yes.
#
; allow_rgb_database=Yes or No. Convenient to use because colorname e.g., red,
;  gold etc can be used instead of rgb components of the color, however it is
;  very inefficient to lookup. If your site is busy, set this option to No.
#
; count_reload=Yes or No. It is a good idea to set this option to No. But
;  you've to set this option to Yes if you are running a proxy server.
;  Normally set this option to Yes.
#
; log_error_messages=Yes or No. If your site is extremely busy and if the
;  counter generates lots of logs, set this option to No. Normally set this
;  option to Yes.
#
; log_visitor_info=Yes or No. If you want to information about visitor, specify
; Yes. The path of the visitor log file is determined at compile time
;
#
; log_rotation_interval=seconds. You can rotate the visitor log file if 
; you wish. You need to enter the interval in seconds. For example if you 
; want to rotate the visitor log ; file in every 30 days, the rotation 
; interval will be 30*24*60*60 = 2592000. The rotating visitor log file 
; names  will be something like ; visitor.log_933120000, visitor.log_935712000.
; If you do not want to rotate visitor log, enter 0 for the interval.
#
; show_error_messages_to_browsers=Yes or No. Set this option to No if you're
;  concerned with privacy and you're sure that the counter works perfectly.
;  If you set this option to No, you will not see error messages.
